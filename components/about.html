            <p id=01><strong><br>International Conference on Frontiers in Information and Computer Security (FICS)<br></strong></p>
                    <p>About the Conference Information security plays an important role in today’s world, whether it is system security, 
                      network security, security of application or device security. Due to the requirements of sophisticated tools to keep 
                      system secure and sound, there is a big need in India and globe for professionals who are well educated about the various 
                      aspects of information security.The goal of the International Conference on Information Security: Systems, 
                      Application and Design (ICISAD) is to bring together the researchers from academia and industry as well as
                       practitioners to share ideas, problems and solutions relating to the multifaceted aspects of Information Security.
                       The target is to focus on the latest trends, techniques and applications areas requiring security. 
                       As the world goes seamless today, everything has become easily available and hence, more vulnerable. 
                       This has also extended the domains of protection from merely data and information to those of devices, networks, 
                       media, and largely to the web based products and applications. On this platform, we intend to bring together all 
                       these perspectives of modern day security.
                    The conference shall be following the standard reviewing process through popular conference management systems 
                    like EDAS. The UP IEEE/ACM section is expected to sponsor the conference technically. The accepted papers shall be 
                    available in conference proceedings, online in IEEE explore after presentation during the conference.</p>
