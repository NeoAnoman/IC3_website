                               in Information and Computer Security from November 5-7th, 2020 The goal of the International Conference on Frontiers in Information and 
                               Computer Security (FICS) is to bring together the researchers from academia and industry as well as practitioners to share ideas, problems
                                and solutions relating to the multifaceted aspects of Information Security. .The target is to focus on the latest trends, techniques and applications areas requiring security. As the world goes seamless today, everything has become easily available and hence, more vulnerable to exploitation. This has also extended the domains of protection from merely data and information to those of devices, networks, media, and largely to the web based products and applications. On this platform, we intend to bring together all these perspectives of modern day security. The conference shall be following the standard reviewing process through popular conference management systems like EDAS. The UP IEEE/ACM section is expected to sponsor the conference technically. The accepted papers shall be available in conference proceedings, online in IEEE explore after presentation during the conference Conference Tracks The papers and ideas to be discussed in this conference aim to cover the following aspects of Information Security: 1. Cryptology 2. Network security. 3. Cyber and digital forensic 4. Software security, reliability and assurance 5. Security, privacy and trust in modern data management. 6. .Intelligent secure systems
